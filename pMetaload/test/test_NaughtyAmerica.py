I mean, you’re having an affair with your girlfriend’s good friend, but it’s really a pain in the ass when you’re all at the same party and you can’t even make the time to fuck your mistress. That’s what happens with Bridgette B. and Ryan. He’s been banging her because of her big tits, which his gf doesn’t have, and they have to constantly meet in the bathroom to start fooling around. But someone’s always knocking on the door busting their hump! Eventually, Bridgette sees Ryan’s girlfriend head out on the phone, so she and Ryan decide to move their soiree into the unknown bedroom in the other room, where they can fuck each others’ brains out!"""
