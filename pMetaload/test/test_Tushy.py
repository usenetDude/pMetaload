    sample_description = """Ella only has two rules when she travels on business - she never stays at the same hotel twice, and she always leaves her wedding ring behind. She has begun having some fun with men she meets while she is away - even though she has no intentions of leaving her husband. This time around she is staying in a small boutique hotel with not many guests, but this isn't going to hold her back - besides, she's always loved a challenge."""
