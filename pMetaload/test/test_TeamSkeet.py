    sample_description = """Isabella Nice was once an innocent teen, until she showed up for her first Team Skeet shoot. From this day on she has become a wild and horny sex doll. She has a mouth that is meant for sucking cock and a tight pussy that is meant for getting drilled. What we like about her most is that she has fun while she is on camera. That is one of the most desired qualities when it comes to any starlet. Add a face full of cum and perfection is not too far away. If you want to give Isabella some love please comment below, and tell us what site you want to see her perform on next!"""
